This mod makes the base income negative instead of positive. 
For example, for a base income of 5 armies, 5 will be subtracted from the players total income instead of being added like it normally would.
Note that the total income can never become negative, and will be at least 0 armies per turn. 

WARNING: With negative base income, the game could become unplayable!!
If a player is unable to capture any more territories they have no way to obtain more income to offset the negative base income, resulting in them getting stuck.
Make sure the settings give players enough options to bridge the first few turns where the bonus income is less than base income.
